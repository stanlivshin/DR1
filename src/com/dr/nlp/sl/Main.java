/**
 * @author Stan Livshin
 * Remote programming exercise 
 * This project should be well tested and code should be checked into GitHub along with any 
 * output produced from running your program. Write your solution in the Java programming 
 * language, using only the standard libraries. Do not use any third-Â­party libraries for natural 
 * language processing. Describe any assumptions you make in your implementation. What are 
 * the limitations of your approach? What other approaches might be possible? At the end of the 
 * assignment there should be a commit/push for each of the following features. 
 
 * 1. Write a program that identifies sentence boundaries and tokenizes the text in the file 
 * "nlp_data.txt" into words. It should correctly process all symbols, including punctuation 
 * and whitespace. Every word must fall into a sentence. Create data structures that 
 * efficiently express the data you have processed. When your program runs it should 
 * output an XML representation of your Java object model.
